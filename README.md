# Professional JavaScript
Take your Javascript programming to the next level with strategies and techniques commonly used in modern full-stack development.

Unlike other courses, Professional JavaScript focuses on modern JavaScript. In most of the others courses, you learn more of the client-oriented JavaScript. You also learn a lot of “old” ways to do things, with old and/or nearly deprecated functions. Worst, you learn a to do things in a bad way. JavaScript evolves, and is more and more written using an event-driven architecture (reactive) and/or with functional paradigm. This course focuses on modern techniques to write code and build a reactive, efficient and modular application architecture.









## What you will learn
* Read and write JavaScript code.
* Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
* Create JavaScript applications using NodeJS and npm.
* Test and debug JavaScript code.
* Have a deep understanding of the multiple programming paradigms of JavaScript and how to apply them.
